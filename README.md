# Vita-SysDualTouch
A simple Vita plugin to navigate system menus with the rear touchpad as well as the front.  
I got inspired to make this plugin after watching [prototype firmware](https://youtu.be/oM857ZqqRa8?t=308) footage again for the first time in a while, and I was a little bit sad that Sony didn't at least keep an option in settings or something for this :(

### Installing
Drop the plugin anywhere on your system, add a new entry in `config.txt` under `*KERNEL`, you probably already know the drill...

Note: Take care when handling your grip on the Vita; rear touches take priority over front touches, so it could be a little bit fiddly if you've got big hands like me :P
